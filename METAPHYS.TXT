Department of Defense Memorandum
Subject: Strategic Framework for Engagement with Metaphysical Planes and Imaginary Constructs

Date: 2023-04-22
From: Office of Emerging Dimensions (OED), Subdirectorate of Unreal Security Concerns
To: Secretary of Defense, Joint Chiefs, Strategic Imagination Task Force

I. Background
The Department of Defense acknowledges the increasing frequency of cross-perceptual contact with metaphysical, imaginative, or otherwise non-causal constructs—particularly in the wake of exploratory cognitive mapping initiatives, anomalous contact events, and the confirmed permeability of the Marshmallow Forest (MF) domain.

While traditional kinetic and cyber operations remain foundational, encounters within or adjacent to metaphysical planes demand a radical reframing of engagement doctrine. Entities and environments in such realms frequently defy material causality, present subjective temporal structures, and possess emotionally-reactive logic frameworks.

II. Threat and Opportunity Assessment
A. Threats
Imagination-Responsive Defense Mechanisms: Constructs such as the “Guardian of Gentle Order” respond not to presence but to intention. Hostile sentiment alone may trigger overwhelming, non-physical countermeasures.

Nonlinear Escalation Risk: Metaphysical retaliation (e.g., “Overwhelming Kindness” tactics) may bypass physical infrastructure and directly impact morale, cognition, or public narrative reality.

Diplomatic Fragility: Missteps in protocol (e.g., unauthorized marshmallow extraction) can provoke disproportionate metaphysical or economic responses.

B. Opportunities
Non-Lethal Influence Channels: Frolic-based environments may be manipulated via emotional or aesthetic signals rather than force projection.

Strategic Access to Novel Resources: Constructs such as Light Sweet Fluffy Grade A marshmallows and ambient ether present unique logistical and scientific opportunities—if properly engaged.

Narrative Supremacy: Dominance in the imaginative domain may allow control over how conflicts are understood and remembered, potentially shaping real-world diplomacy.

III. Recommended Strategic Principles
Narrative Conformity
Engagement must respect internal logic structures. Agents must adopt culturally aligned identities and behaviors (e.g., “joy facilitators” rather than “liaison officers”).

Emotional Camouflage
Operatives in metaphysical domains should undergo training in emotional masking. Intent is often more observable than action.

Containment by Consent
Construct containment (if necessary) must appear voluntary. Any sense of coercion is likely to cause conceptual instability.

Information Osmosis Only
Direct intelligence extraction is discouraged. Use embedded observational agents ("Wanderers") trained to dream-share and record symbolic patterns.

Do Not Attempt Rationalization in Field
Imaginary constructs often destabilize when forced into logical coherence. Operatives must “play along” to maintain structure integrity.

IV. Action Items
Expand the Defense Imaginary Sciences Program (DISP) with cross-agency participation from State, HHS (mental health frameworks), and DARPA (dimensional mapping).

Deploy a joint task group to study the feasibility of tactile diplomacy using symbolic offerings (e.g., metaphorically significant art or sensory gifts).

Issue new DoD-3227-IC clearances for operatives trained in nonlinear affective environments.

Open backchannel communication with the Marshmallow Cartel via willing intermediaries (e.g., Zuck the pink deer, if diplomatic rapport can be formalized).
