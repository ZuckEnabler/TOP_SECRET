APPENDIX B
Imaginary Entity Classification Framework (IECF-6)
Department of Defense – Office of Emerging Dimensions
For Internal Use Only | Not for Distribution to Interplanar Parties

I. Overview
Imaginary entities encountered in non-causal realms—particularly within the Marshmallow Forest—exhibit stable-enough traits to warrant taxonomical classification for the purposes of communication, behavioral prediction, and existential risk assessment. This framework uses a six-axis scale to classify such entities based on interactional, emotional, metaphysical, and ontological properties.

Each entity is profiled by a six-letter designation.

II. Axis Definitions
F: Frolic Alignment
Describes the entity’s commitment to maintaining harmony within its native emotional logic (e.g., Frolic, Serenity, Reverie).

F+: Actively promotes Frolic; reliable and peaceful

F0: Neutral to Frolic; may be transactional or oblivious

F−: Disruptive; considered a threat to metaphysical harmony

C: Conceptual Solidity
Represents how stable the entity’s identity is across encounters.

C+: Appears consistent in form and behavior

C0: Changes shape, tone, or logic but retains underlying theme

C−: Fractured or dreamlike; may dissolve during analysis

T: Teleological Drift
Measures the degree to which the entity pursues a clear internal purpose.

T+: Has and expresses stable goals

T0: Displays reactive or ambiguous behavior

T−: Exists without understandable purpose

E: Emotional Reciprocity
Indicates whether the entity responds coherently to human emotional states.

E+: Empathic or mirroring

E0: Emotionally opaque

E−: Absorbs or weaponizes emotional states

R: Real-World Permeability
Degree to which the entity can influence, appear in, or attach to phenomena in the real world.

R+: Leaves traces, dreams, or psychic echoes

R0: Fully contained within its native realm

R−: Reality-incompatible; anchoring impossible

M: Material Sympathy
How well the entity understands or interacts with physical matter (e.g., clothing, tools, gravity).

M+: Navigates material systems intuitively

M0: Intermittent interaction; unpredictable material contact

M−: Ignores or deforms material logic

III. Example Profiles
Zuck

FCTERM: F+ C+ T+ E+ R+ M0

Interpretation: Highly Frolic-aligned, emotionally responsive, purposeful and stable across realms. Can influence human dreams and emotional landscapes, but interacts with material reality selectively.

Guardian of Gentle Order

FCTERM: F+ C+ T+ E0 R0 M+

Interpretation: Institutionally Frolic-aligned enforcer. Lacks conventional empathy but follows strict preservation logic. Engages firmly with material infrastructure, particularly in enforcement scenarios.

Unmoored Cloud of Laughter (Suspected Entity)

FCTERM: F0 C− T− E+ R+ M−

Interpretation: Fragmented construct possibly formed from overlapping dream events. Emotionally absorbing, without clear purpose. Has caused localized metaphysical disturbances.

Cartel Acolyte (General)

FCTERM: F+ C+ T+ E0 R0 M+

Interpretation: Reliable agents of Frolic maintenance. Purpose-driven, physically stable, emotionally closed-off to outsiders. Trusted within metaphysical diplomacy.

IV. Usage Notes
Classification is meant as a living tool, subject to revision with encounter logs.

Ratings may shift over time or under stress (e.g., E+ becoming E− if trust is broken).

Operatives are advised not to inform entities of their classification. Awareness may trigger logic unraveling or self-reconstruction events.
