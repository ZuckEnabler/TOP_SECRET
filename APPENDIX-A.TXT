APPENDIX A
Operational Guidelines for Personnel Assigned to Metaphysical Postings
Document Reference: DoD-3227-IC-A
Classification: CONFIDENTIAL

1. Pre-Deployment Conditioning
A. Cognitive Unbinding Protocol
Agents must complete guided sessions in non-linear perception, dissociative meditation, and lucid imagination anchoring.

Standard intelligence analysis tools (e.g., structured analytic techniques) are not to be used while immersed; they induce conceptual rejection.

B. Narrative Persona Construction
All operatives must assume internally consistent metaphysical personas, aligned with host domain expectations.

Example: In the Marshmallow Forest, operatives may be assigned roles such as “Healer of Hollow Moments” or “Cartographer of Laughter.”

Any rank insignia or reference to real-world authority must be concealed or symbolically reinterpreted.

2. Behavioral Mandates
A. Engagement Conduct
Greet locals with gestures of soft mirth (smiling without showing teeth, offering ephemeral objects such as feathers, riddles, or music).

Never speak in declarative absolute terms. Preferred tones are suggestive, whimsical, or contemplative.

Avoid touching fruiting bodies (e.g., marshmallows) unless offered. Consumption must occur on site, and always with gratitude.

B. Combat Prohibition
The use of physical weapons is both ineffective and diplomatically catastrophic.

Emotional aggression, suspicion, or transactional behavior may be perceived as hostile acts, potentially invoking Overwhelming Kindness (ritualized, often irreversible pacification).

3. Safety Protocols
A. Ether Exposure
Ether should only be consumed under supervision of local guides or authorized Cartel liaisons.

High ether saturation may induce metaphysical blending, narrative drift, or non-verbal communion. Symptoms include:

Speaking in third person reflexively

Perception of time as flavor

Desire to "dissolve into kindness"

B. Navigational Anchoring
Each operative is assigned a memory totem (an object tied to real-world identity). This must be kept on the body at all times.

Anchoring phrases (e.g., “I serve two worlds.”) should be mentally repeated in moments of metaphysical uncertainty.

4. Reporting Requirements
Field reports must be submitted via DreamLog Interface, with emotional tone encoding included.

Objective data (if any) should be translated into metaphor-first structures for internal decoding.

Example: “Three marshmallow groves turned toward us during our approach” may indicate increased local alertness.

5. Prohibited Conduct
Attempting to rationalize, monetize, or extract metaphysical resources without consent.

Introducing real-world technology directly (e.g., sensors, drones) into narrative ecosystems.

Speaking the phrase “This isn’t real” while within realm boundaries.

6. Emergency Extraction Protocol
In the event of spiritual unraveling, narrative entrapment, or imminent kindness application, operatives should:

Cease resistance.

Speak aloud a known poem or memory.

Wait for Cartel liaisons or local stabilizers to initiate dreamfold repatriation.

Note: Extraction is not guaranteed if emotional causality has been compromised.
